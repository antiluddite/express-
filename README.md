To start, it, use nodemon wherever you would normally use the node command:
    nodemon server

t
Make sure you have a separate terminal opened into mongodb file
use:

    mongod --dbpath=data 

in the mongodb folder to run.
have that running in the background before you run node-mongoose 

file path (on a mac) will be: 
/Users/<username>/Desktop/NucampFolder/5-NodeJS-Express-MongoDB/mongodb

install mongoose and mongoose-currency in the nucampsiteServer folder: 
     npm install mongoose@5.10.9 mongoose-currency@0.2.0

If you have difficulties running in the terminal(saying it cannot find 'mongoose') try:
    npm install mongoose
